Provide `options` to indicate whether `func`\n * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`\n * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the\n * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the\n * result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.throttle` and `_.debounce`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to throttle.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to throttle invocations to.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new throttled function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid excessively updating the position while scrolling.\n * jQuery(window).on('scroll', _.throttle(updatePosition, 100));\n *\n * // Invoke `renewToken` when the click event is fired, but not more than once every 5 minutes.\n * var throttled = _.throttle(renewToken, 300000, { 'trailing': false });\n * jQuery(element).on('click', throttled);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing throttled invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', throttled.cancel);\n */\nfunction throttle(func, wait, options) {\n  var leading = true,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n
